<p>
  <strong>Overview:</strong><br>
  Lightweight, standardized classification engine for general machine learning tasks.<br>
  (GSMST SCE Maker Project)
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Purpose:</strong><br>
  The end goal of this project is to create an all encompassing ML algorithm that automatically finds the best classification method for an individual dataset, serving as a standalone system for instantaneous predictions and lightweight model retraining, having lower runtimes and resource utilization than existing frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, SKLearn), while maintaining similar levels of classification accuracy.
