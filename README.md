<p>
  <strong>Overview:</strong><br>
  Lightweight, standardized classification engine for general machine learning tasks.<br>
  (GSMST SCE Maker Project)
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Purpose:</strong><br>
  The end goal of this project is to create an all encompassing ML algorithm that automatically finds the best classification method for an individual dataset, serving as a standalone module for instantaneous predictions and lightweight model retraining, having lower runtimes and resource utilization than existing frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, SKLearn), while maintaining similar levels of classification accuracy.<br>
  Such a system eliminates the need for human trial and error when choosing a classification technique, allowing for an automatic classification algorithm switch as a dataset grows through the use of a standardized model.<br>
  Finally, this system removes the overhead of large inferencing frameworks, making for faster classifications and model training times without the need for GPU acceleration.
